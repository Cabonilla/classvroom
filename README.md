# ClassVROOM

A Zoom clone with full multimedia capabilities and dynamic canvas collaboration..

Pretty broken as of yet, to be honest. Not smooth or reliable. That said, it's a pretty good experiment. 

Users can meet in the same room (link) and collaborate using the canvas. Video sharing not available on purpose yet. No live version yet, and it's using Node JS and would require hosting. 

**Required languages**: HTML, CSS, JS, FabricJS, Express, Socket IO
